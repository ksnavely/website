# website

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/ksnavely/website.svg?branch=develop)

This repo contains a basic flask server for my personal website. It's meant to be served behind a proxy server and is pretty straightforward.

Currently this website is served at http://www.kdevops.com

See my [ansible-repo](https://github.com/ksnavely/ansible-repo) for details behind the system stack that serves this flask app.

The project uses git-flow which I manage with [cirrus](https://github.com/evansde77/cirrus), a git extension for managing python applications.
