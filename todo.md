Here's a good old todo list of things to scope further or just do:
  - promote the ansible setup to it's own repo following best practices
  - set up the website (flask) repo for itself and polish:
    - versioned releases
    - basic unit tests
    - travis
  - rockfall
    - tests? travis?
  - ansible:
    - staging v. production
    - use a community playbook
  - promote provisioning guide to code
  - fix nginx bug
  - better monitoring
